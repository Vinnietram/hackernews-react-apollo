# Hacker News Apollo

Created a standard ReactApp for deploying on GitHub https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-page 

Followed https://www.howtographql.com/ and the practical https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction/ to dip toes into world of GraphQL

Notes to self:

- Need to fire up Apollo server locally to for React page on Github to see news
  - switch into Apollo server directory and "npm start" on port 4000.
- Didn't do caching in section https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/6-more-mutations-and-updating-the-store/
- https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/8-subscriptions/ (todo)
- https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/9-pagination/ (todo)
